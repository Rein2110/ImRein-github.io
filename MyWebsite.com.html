             <p>Hello My name is Reybeen U. Romero from Caloocan city i just want to share my story ....... I started learning basic HTML when I was in Grade 11, then I stopped because I couldn't use it because what was taught to us was C++, but I didn't study C++ very much because it was only an online class, it would have been better if it was face to face classes, So until I was in Grade 12, I didn't know much about C++, so when I was in Grade 12, at that time, I was already listening and they taught us Visual Basic 6.0, and I learned a lot, so every time there is an activities and quizzes I improve it because I want my programming to be good and the designs I have programed are beautiful until now, some I remember and others I don't HAHAHA
                Now, I'm currently in college, the course I took is BS Computer Science.</p>
